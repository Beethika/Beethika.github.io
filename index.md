# About Me
<div style = "text-align: justify"> I am currently pursuing my M.S. under Dr. Balaraman Ravindran and co-guided by Dr. Karthik Raman at IIT Madras. I joined IIT Madras in July 2015. My area of research is Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Complex Network Analysis. I am working on community detection algorithms and network representation learning algorithms to figure out structural patterns in the network that are responsible for various diseases. I am also looking at combining information from multiple networks (or multiplex network) whose nodes are same but they share a different biological relationship.
